Personal tracker for bike trips v 1.0

Here should be rather simple tracker for my bike trips.
As it's a personal learning project I'm going to use c++.

The first version will be just a console app which will allow user to manually input information about trip and store it in a database.
The second option is to get data from remote server of vendor of wearing electronics, in my case it's Huawei so I will try to work with their api.
Also there will be output to console: just every row from a database and the sum of kilometers for the whole season.

In the future everything will be moved to Qt in order to use GUI and gain even more knowledge.
